Setting up client tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this Lab we will look at how to install the OpenShift CLI tools.

*Installing the Command-line Tools*

After completing this section, you should be able to:

* Locate the binaries for the OpenShift Container Platform command-line
interface (OCP CLI)
* Install the OCP CLI tools.
* CLI basic configuration

*Locating the binaries*

The OCP CLI exposes commands for managing applications, as well as
lower-level tools to interact with each component of a system. The
binaries for Mac, Windows, and Linux are available for download from the
Red Hat Customer Portal via the following URL.  Make sure you download the lastest/most 
recent version of the product.

* Supported Binary from the Red Hat Portal: https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290

*Installing the CLI tools*

The CLI is provided as compressed files that can be decompressed to any
directory. In order to make it simple for any user to access the OCP
CLI, it is recommended that it is made available in a directory mapped
to the environment variable called `PATH` from the OS. More information
can be found about installation process here:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html

1.  *OSX and Linux:*
+
1.1. Copy the binary to the `/usr/local/bin` directory, or one of the
paths listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
2.  *Windows:*
+
2.1. Use oc.exe to open an OpenShift shell. If you getting error from
running oc, go to git-scm.com to download git bash for Windows (during
installation you need to specify in the selection to integrate with the
command prompt)


*CLI basic configuration*

The easiest way to initially setup the OpenShift CLI is to use the
`oc login` command. Itâ€™ll interactively ask you a server URL, username
and password. The information is automatically saved in a CLI
configuration file that is then used for subsequent commands.

To login to a remote server use:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login <hostname>:<port>
